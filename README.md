# Home health monitoring app built using React Native

This is a React Native app, where you can create a user and see live health data from your home(with an external sensor, but the app works without a sensor too), and compete with others in the leaderboard. 

## Tech stack

The front-end is built using React Native Typescript, structured after Atomic Design. The authentication is done using Cognito, and the backend for the leaderboard and the live data is done using AWS Amplify Datastore and Firebase Realtime Database

## Heads up
You wont be able to run this React Native app without access to the AWS Amplify credentials, so please only use this repository for the code. Feel free to contact me, if you want a demonstration of the app, or access to run the app yourself.
