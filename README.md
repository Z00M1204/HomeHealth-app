This is an mobile app, where you can create a user and see live health data from your home(with external sensor, but app works without sensor too), and compete with others in the leaderboard. 

The front-end is built using React Native Typescript, structured after Atomic Design. The authentication is done using Cognito, and the backend for the leaderboard and the live data is done using AWS Amplify Datastore and Firebase Realtime Database
